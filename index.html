			<p>Where we cage our very own honey badger for your educational purposes! We will track and monitor Phil the honeybadger so that you can explore the ravenous yet majestic creatures known as honey badgers! Follow us as our handlers and photographers interact with Phil!</p>

			<footer>No honey badgers were harmed in the making of this website. Due to the flamboyantly aggressive nature of the animal some handlers and photographers were maimed by Phil.</footer>
